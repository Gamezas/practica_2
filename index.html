[Verse 1]
A sudden evening shower, no umbrella, ugh
Why would I know how the sky was feeling?
What should I wear between seasons?
Whatever happened to spring and autumn?

[Pre-Chorus]
I can't breathe from all the informational pressure
In a spiral of dizziness, where am I?
The sound of my breath
Is making so much so much noise

[Chorus]
It's not enough, not enough, nobody notices
Unable to make a hastily scribbled sound, I shouted
Who am I supposed to show "my real self" to?
The idiot that I am, I just sing
Why don't I just lay it all out to the stars?

[Verse 2]
I just kind of go about restringing with Elixir
I softly touch my chipped nail
With its 300mm radius body, it cries out frantically
This place right here is music's world

[Pre-Chorus]
I grasp at air and punch thе sky
Nothing happens, I'm powerless
But whеn that hand hits steel
Something changed, so it seemed
[Chorus]
So bright, bright, don't shine so brightly
Don't want my dorky shadow getting any darker
Why am I so fired up? I can't stop
The idiot that I am, I just sing
My heart, you're too loud

[Bridge]
The blue planet, all alone
It's been listening to so much sound
Spinning for hundreds and millions of years
If only for just a second, ah
Please listen, listen

[Chorus]
I, I, I am here
Unable to make a hastily scribbled sound, I shouted
I want, I want to be something, just be someone
The idiot that I am, I just sing
Why don't I just lay it all out to the stars

[Verse 1]
(Me + Expectation - Anxiety) x Guitar = Rock
(Me + You - Time) ÷ Guitar = Live Performance

[Pre-Chorus]
Trembling with fear
Eight bars before the showtime
Breaking down the inferiority complex
I leaped into the light

[Chorus]
A new world was born
This time, this place, like a pipe dream
Every minute, every second is a miracle, a twinkling moment
Let's drop meaning into the gaps of everyday life
Even if things don't go well
Evеn if I can't face forward
This phrase, this song, the sound I rеally like
Strumming hard, yet still just strumming
Let's try to deliver, even if clumsy
Let's tie it all together, no matter where it leads

[Verse 2]
(Me + World - Communication) x Understanding = I'm Out
Me + You are biased
Sound ÷ Infinite Loop = Band, ah-ah
(Ah, ah, ah)

[Bridge]
Running around reality
Idealism comes to a sudden stop
Manipulating illusions
Sitting in seiza on a remote island revealing my true self
Throwing away preconceptions
Feeling a premonition tonight
A song that dives into the light ahead

[Chorus]
A new world was born
This time, this place, like a pipe dream
Every minute, every second is a miracle, a twinkling moment
Let's house our will in the gaps of everyday life
Even if it's incomprehensible
Even if it's nonsense
This scale, this drive, the sound I really like
No matter how I strum, it's still just strumming
Let's try to deliver, even if clumsy
Let's try to play, these days
Let's tie it all together

[Outro]
Now (Now), tomorrow too (Tomorrow too)
More (More), surely
No matter where it leads
